# Business Site

This project is about a fictional online clothing store. I have used forms and accordions in this project. The site is responsive.

## The problem

I didn't really encounter any big problems. I would say that the styling of the form was the hardest part and the part I would put more time into if I indeed had more time.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
